The REDCap Deployment project would not be possible without generous contributions from our authors and funders.

David R Nelson, Director of the University of Florida Clinical Translational Science Institute, provides funding support for the UF CTSI REDCap team via UF CTSA Award and matching funds from the UF Office of Research.

Matthew McConnell provided excellent examples of Fabric API tools in his work on the [Quality Improvement Registry](https://github.com/ctsit/qipr_approver).

Philip Chase (philipbchase@gmail.com) was the principle designer on the project.  The development team includes Philip Chase, Sreeja Kannagundla, Stewart Wehmeyer, Taryn Stoffs, and Erik C. Schmidt.

Taryn Stoffs, Amber L. Allen, Christopher P. Barnes, Matthew McConnell, Patrick F. White, Kevin S. Hanson, and Taryn Stoffs provided valuable contributions to documentation and publications.
